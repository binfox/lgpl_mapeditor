          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Can I use my maps in commercial games?</b><br>
              Yes, you can use FREEversion- or PROversion-maps in your game.<br><br>
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Can I include the FREEversion of map editor with my game?</b><br>
              Yes, you can include the FREEversion with your game. You can either include the entire mapeditor .ZIP file or you can include the individual unzipped files (mapeditor.exe, help files, etc.). But you can't include the PROversion with your game (copyright and license problems)!<br><br>
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Should I write something about this editor in my game?</b><br>
              If you use FREEversion, please include a link (www.mapeditor.de.vu) in the game, documents or website. If you use PROversion, then you don't need to do this.<br><br>
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>I bought PROversion. Can I create one copy on CD?</b><br>
              Yes, you should do this. If you lose the PROversion, you won't be able to replace it without purchasing another copy.<br><br>
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>I created map files with another editor. Can I load those files into Universal Map Editor?</b><br>
              No, this is not possible. Universal Map Editor only accepts its own map files.<br><br>
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>I created map files with FREEversion. Can I load those files into PROversion?</b><br>
              Yes, without problems. But FREEversion can't load PROversion maps!<br><br>
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>I don't know how to write the code to include the map in my game. Can you write this?</b><br>
              No. There is no free programming support. You can use map files in many programming languages but most problems are individual.<br><br>
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Can I create maps similar to "SimCity 2000" or "Marble Madness" with this editor?</b><br>
              Only with some limitations. This editor was designed for flat maps. It is only possible to create maps with some depth. One tile in "Marble Madness" has X,Y,Z-coordinates, tilenumber, and z-order-value. All tiles must be sorted. As you can see, you would need other algorithms and some special editor features.<br><br>
